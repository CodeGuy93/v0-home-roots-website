# Kansas Homeschool Starter Kit

Kansas offers a straightforward approach to homeschooling through its "non-accredited private school" provision. This allows families to establish their own home-based educational program with minimal regulation while maintaining educational freedom.

## Kansas Homeschool Laws Overview

In Kansas, homeschools operate as non-accredited private schools. This means:

- You must register your homeschool with the Kansas State Department of Education as a non-accredited private school
- You need to provide instruction by a competent person (no specific qualifications required)
- You must teach for a "substantially equivalent" period as public schools (generally interpreted as 186 days)
- There are no required subjects, standardized testing, or teacher certification requirements
- No curriculum approval or student assessment reporting is required

This framework gives Kansas homeschooling families significant freedom to design educational programs tailored to their children's needs while maintaining minimal compliance requirements.

  gettingStarted: `
## Getting Started with Homeschooling in Kansas

### Step 1: Register Your Non-Accredited Private School
- Complete the "Registration of Non-Accredited Private School" form available on the Kansas State Department of Education website
- Choose a name for your homeschool (many families use "[Family Name] Academy" or similar)
- Submit the form to the Kansas State Department of Education
- Registration is a one-time requirement unless you change your school's name or address

### Step 2: Withdraw from Public School (if applicable)
If your child is currently enrolled in public school, notify the school in writing of your intent to withdraw them for homeschooling.

### Step 3: Plan Your School Year
Kansas requires non-accredited private schools to provide instruction for a period "substantially equivalent" to public schools (186 days). You have flexibility in how you schedule these days.

### Step 4: Select Curriculum and Materials
Kansas does not mandate specific subjects or curriculum, giving you freedom to choose materials that fit your educational philosophy and your child's learning style.

### Step 5: Establish Record-Keeping Systems
While Kansas doesn't require specific records, it's wise to maintain:
- Attendance records
- Basic curriculum plans
- Samples of student work
- Progress reports or grades

### Step 6: Connect with Support Groups
Join Kansas homeschool groups and co-ops to connect with other homeschooling families for support, resource sharing, and socialization opportunities.
