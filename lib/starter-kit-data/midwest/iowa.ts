# Iowa Homeschool Starter Kit

Iowa offers multiple legal options for homeschooling families, providing flexibility while maintaining educational standards. The state has evolved its homeschool laws over the years to become more accommodating to different homeschooling approaches.

## Iowa Homeschool Laws Overview

In Iowa, families can choose from several homeschooling options:

1. **Independent Private Instruction (IPI)** - The most flexible option with minimal requirements
2. **Competent Private Instruction (CPI) Option 1** - Using a licensed teacher
3. **Competent Private Instruction (CPI) Option 2** - Parent-directed education with optional reporting
4. **Home School Assistance Program (HSAP)** - District-supported homeschooling with resources

Each option has different requirements regarding notification, assessment, and supervision. This starter kit will help you navigate these choices and get started on your homeschooling journey in Iowa.
