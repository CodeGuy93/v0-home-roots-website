# Minnesota Homeschool Starter Kit

Minnesota has a well-established homeschooling community with moderate regulations that balance educational freedom with accountability. The state recognizes homeschooling as a valid educational option and provides clear guidelines for families choosing this path.

## Minnesota Homeschool Laws Overview

In Minnesota, homeschooling families must:

- File an initial report with their school district superintendent by October 1 each year (or within 15 days of withdrawing a child from public school)
- Maintain documentation including an annual report, quarterly report cards, and samples of student work
- Ensure instruction is provided by a person who meets one of several qualification options
- Administer an annual nationally norm-referenced standardized achievement test
- Cover required subjects including reading, writing
