## Getting Started with Homeschooling in Indiana

### Step 1: Understand Your Legal Options
Indiana recognizes homeschools as non-accredited, nonpublic schools. This means you have significant freedom in how you structure your homeschool program.

### Step 2: Withdraw from Public School (if applicable)
If your child is currently enrolled in public school, submit a withdrawal letter to the school administration. While not legally required, this is a professional courtesy and helps ensure a smooth transition.

### Step 3: Plan Your School Year
Indiana requires homeschools to operate for the same number of days as public schools (180 days), but you have flexibility in how you schedule these days.

### Step 4: Keep Required Records
Maintain attendance records, which are the only records explicitly required by law. However, it's advisable to also keep:
- Basic curriculum plans
- Samples of student work
- Progress reports or grades
- Any standardized test results

### Step 5: Begin Homeschooling
You can start homeschooling at any time during the year. There's no need to wait for the beginning of a traditional school year.

### Step 6: Connect with Local Support
Join Indiana homeschool groups and co-ops to connect with other homeschooling families for support, resource sharing, and socialization opportunities.

## Record-Keeping for Indiana Homeschoolers

Indiana has minimal record-keeping requirements, but maintaining good records is still important for your child's educational journey.

### Required Records
- **Attendance Records**: The only legally required records in Indiana. Document the 180 instructional days required by law.

### Recommended Records
While not legally required, these records are beneficial to maintain:

1. **Curriculum Plans**
   - Annual overview of subjects to be covered
   - List of textbooks and major resources used

2. **Academic Records**
   - Samples of student work from throughout the year
   - Reading lists
   - Project descriptions and photos
   - Tests and evaluations

3. **High School Records**
   - Create a transcript with courses, grades, and credits
   - Document extracurricular activities
   - Keep standardized test scores (SAT/ACT)
   - Consider creating a portfolio of best work

4. **Immunization Records**
   - While homeschoolers are exempt from public school immunization requirements, keeping these records is still advisable

### Record-Keeping Tips
- Set up a simple filing system at the beginning of each school year
- Take regular photos of projects, field trips, and activities
- Consider using a homeschool planner or digital tracking system
- Update records weekly rather than trying to reconstruct them later
- Store digital backups of important documents
