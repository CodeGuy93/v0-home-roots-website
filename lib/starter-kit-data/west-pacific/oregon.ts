# Oregon Homeschool Starter Kit

Welcome to homeschooling in Oregon! The Beaver State offers a balanced approach to homeschooling with moderate regulations that provide both structure and flexibility. Oregon's diverse landscapes—from the Pacific coast to the Cascade mountains to high desert—provide wonderful opportunities for place-based learning that can enrich your homeschool experience.

## Oregon Homeschool Laws Overview

In Oregon, homeschooling families must:

- Notify their local Education Service District (ESD) when beginning homeschooling and when the student withdraws from homeschooling
- Ensure children are tested using an approved standardized test at the end of grades 3, 5, 8, and 10
- Submit test results to the ESD
- If test scores fall below the 15th percentile, additional requirements may apply

Oregon does not:
- Require specific subjects
- Mandate hours or days of instruction
- Require parent qualifications
- Require curriculum approval
- Mandate record-keeping (though it's recommended)
- Require regular reporting beyond testing

This framework gives Oregon homeschooling families significant freedom to design educational programs tailored to their children's needs while maintaining basic accountability through periodic testing.

## Getting Started with Homeschooling in Oregon

### Step 1: Submit Your Notice of Intent
Notify your local Education Service District (ESD) of your intent to homeschool:
- Within 10 days of withdrawing your child from public school, OR
- Within 10 days of moving to a new ESD, OR
- By your child's 7th birthday if they've never attended public school

The notification should include:
- Child's name and age
- Parent's name and address
- Parent's signature

### Step 2: Plan Your Educational Approach
Oregon doesn't mandate specific subjects, so you have freedom to choose your educational philosophy:
- Traditional textbook approach
- Classical education
- Charlotte Mason method
- Montessori at home
- Unschooling
- Eclectic/hybrid approaches
- Online or virtual school options

### Step 3: Prepare for Required Testing
Plan for standardized testing at the end of grades 3, 5, 8, and 10. Approved tests include:
- Iowa Test of Basic Skills
- Stanford Achievement Test
- TerraNova
- And others approved by the Oregon Department of Education

Tests must be administered by a qualified neutral person (not the parent).

### Step 4: Set Up Record-Keeping Systems
While not required by law, maintaining good records helps track progress and prepare for testing. Consider keeping:
- Curriculum plans
- Samples of student work
- Reading lists
- Field trip documentation
- Progress reports

### Step 5: Connect with Local Resources
Oregon has a vibrant homeschool community with support groups in most regions. Connecting with other homeschooling families can provide support, shared resources, and socialization opportunities.

### Step 6: Take Advantage of Oregon's Unique Learning Opportunities
Incorporate field trips to:
- Oregon coast for marine biology
- Cascade mountains for geology
- High desert for ecology
- Portland museums for art and science
- Historical sites throughout the state
- State parks and wilderness areas
