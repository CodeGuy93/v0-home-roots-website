# Homeschooling in Hawaii

Hawaii offers a relatively straightforward path to homeschooling with moderate regulations. The state recognizes homeschooling as an alternative educational program and provides clear guidelines for families who choose this educational option.

## Legal Framework

In Hawaii, homeschooling falls under Hawaii Revised Statutes §302A-1132, which allows for homeschooling as an alternative educational program. Parents have the right to educate their children at home by following specific notification procedures and meeting certain requirements.

## Key Requirements

- **Notification**: Parents must submit a notice of intent to homeschool to the principal of the local public school.
- **Instruction Time**: 3 hours per day, 175 days per year.
- **Subjects**: Must include language arts, mathematics, science, social studies, and health.
- **Assessment**: Annual progress reports are required, which can be standardized tests, progress reports by certified teachers, or other methods approved by the state.
- **Records**: Maintain attendance records, samples of work, and assessment results.

Hawaii's tropical climate and rich cultural heritage provide unique opportunities for experiential learning and outdoor education throughout the year.
