# Montana Homeschool Starter Kit

Welcome to homeschooling in Montana! The Treasure State offers a straightforward approach to homeschooling with reasonable requirements that respect parental freedom while ensuring educational accountability. Montana's vast landscapes and rich history provide wonderful opportunities for place-based learning that can enhance your homeschool experience.

## Montana Homeschool Laws Overview

In Montana, homeschools operate as "home schools" under the law, and the requirements are relatively simple:

- Parents must notify the county superintendent annually of their intent to homeschool
- Instruction must be provided for at least 180 days of the year
- Instruction must cover the basic subjects of reading, writing, mathematics, social studies, science, health, physical education, art, and music
- Parents must maintain attendance records
- No standardized testing is required
- No parent qualification requirements
- No curriculum approval needed
- No home visits

Montana law respects the right of parents to direct their children's education while maintaining basic accountability through the annual notification process. This balanced approach gives families significant freedom to create educational experiences tailored to their children's needs and interests.

## Getting Started with Homeschooling in Montana

### Step 1: Submit Your Notice of Intent
Complete a homeschool notification form and submit it to your county superintendent's office. This must be done:
