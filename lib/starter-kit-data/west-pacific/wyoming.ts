# Wyoming Homeschool Starter Kit

Welcome to homeschooling in Wyoming! The Equality State offers some of the most homeschool-friendly laws in the nation, giving families significant freedom in how they educate their children. Wyoming's stunning landscapes—from the Grand Tetons to Yellowstone to the high plains—provide wonderful opportunities for place-based learning that can enrich your homeschool experience.

## Wyoming Homeschool Laws Overview

In Wyoming, homeschools operate as "home-based educational programs" under the law. The requirements are minimal:

- Submit an annual notification to your local school district
- Provide a sequentially progressive curriculum including reading, writing, mathematics, civics, history, literature, and science
- Provide 175 days of instruction
- Submit curriculum to the school board only if requested

Wyoming does not:
- Require parent qualifications
- Mandate standardized testing
- Require portfolio reviews or evaluations
- Require specific hours of instruction
- Require home visits

This approach reflects Wyoming's values of independence and parental rights, giving homeschooling families significant freedom to create educational experiences tailored to their children's needs and interests.

## Getting Started with Homeschooling in Wyoming

### Step 1: Submit Your Notice of Intent
File a written notice with your local school district:

The notice should include:
- Names and ages of the children to be homeschooled
- Address and telephone number of the home

You have complete freedom in how you teach these subjects and what materials you use. Consider incorporating Wyoming's rich history, natural resources, and outdoor opportunities into your curriculum.

- Outdoor learning areas

### Step 5: Connect with Local Resources
Wyoming has a growing homeschool community with support groups in most regions. Connecting with other homeschooling families can provide support, shared resources, and socialization opportunities.

Incorporate field trips to:
- Yellowstone National Park
- Grand Teton National Park
